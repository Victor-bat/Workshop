        <h1>About Him</h1>
        <p>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong) was an Indian
          scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons
          programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.From 1992 to 1999 Kalam was scientific adviser to
          India’s defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government,
          with the rank of cabinet minister. During this period he played a key role in the government’s weaponization
          of missile systems, giving India nuclear capabilities. In 1998 he was one of the chief coordinators of the
          Pokhran-II series of nuclear tests, in which five bombs were detonated at a test range in the town of Pokhran,
          Rajasthan state. His prominent role in the country’s nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power
          and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international
          community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a
          road map for transforming India from a less-developed society to a developed one in 20 years. Among other
          measures, the plan called for increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for
          economic growth, and for widening access to health care and education.</p>
